# SodaplayerSample

This is Android app, it from https://github.com/sodapanda/sodaplayer
I export to Android Studio from Eclipse IDE.
It has some bug.

Test plan:

1. Server: Use VLC make stream server, you can set http or rtsp protocol.
2. Client: Open app and input network path, ex. http://IP:8080 or rtsp://IP:8554
